# BIMnerd Clashsets
 Navisworks clashsets by BIMnerd

This clashset is build for the dutch NL-sfb coding schema.

It uses searchsets that are grouped by a naming convention and differentiated between an 'almost good' use of the schema (bijna). And good use of the schema (goed). Almost good we can still use for clashing.

Use the xml by importing it via the clash detective
